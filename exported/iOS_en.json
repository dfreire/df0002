Making the wine was actually the easiest part of the process. The challenge was to overcome all the legal problems related to the label approval. As a table wine the label could not mention: region involved , year of harvest, year of bottling, or the history of the wine...\n\nNevertheless, the result was a lovely perfumed wine, with raspberry fruit aromas, richness and freshness on the palate, firm tannins, bright acidity, and with a creamy feel to the whole.\n\nDado was produced in 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004 and the distribution was limited to Portugal.

The summer that followed was hot and relatively dry, which allowed the grapes to mature well.\nThe vinification philosophy was to respect the grapes and nature and focus on seeking the expression of the terroir of Serra da Estrela, thus, no other product was used except sulphur.\nAlcoholic fermentation took place in open vats with traditional treading and began naturally, with the yeast from the vine itself, to express its identity in the purest form. \nVery little extraction was sought. After pressing, the wine was placed directly into used French oak barrels, where malolactic fermentation took place until the following spring and where it aged for 16 months. \nRacking was carried out by gravity and pitchers. Bottling took place in March 2013.","tastingNotes":"This wine expresses the character and elegance of the land that witnessed its birth and takes us on a journey through time to discover the aromas and flavours of Serra da Estrela foothills, just as they were back in the time of our forefathers.\nMineral aromas and flavours of granite and fresh red forest fruits. With vegetal nuances and perfumed by small flowers, pine needles and pine forest. Delicate, pure, tightly knit, full of life, elegant and structured, it is noteworthy because of its fresh and persistent balance.","producer":"António Madeira","region":"Dão ","soilType":"Granite","vines":"Old vineyards","averageVineAge":"50 years","castVarieties":"Tinta Pinheira, Negro Mouro, Tinta Amarela , Baga and other native grape varieties","pruningMethod":"Guyot","altFromSeaLevel":"450","harvestPeriod":"21st September 2011","wayOfHarvest":"Hand picked","malolatic":"Barrel","fermentation":"Open vats with controlled temperature","bottledDate":"March 2013","ageing":"16 months in used French oak barrels (250 L)","production":"1.500 bottles","foodSuggestions":"Lamb, duck, codfish.","alcohol":12.5,"image":"/9e81510c-1e92-43dd-a4ea-ab67755bd01a.jpg"}]},{"title":"Ultreia","description":"Raul Perez is a study in contrasts.

The month in which good weather finally arrived and the winemaking work began. May, June and July were normal, August and September hot. \nThe yield was a little bit more generous. Almost 900 litres were produced. The grapes were foot pressed and the wine fermented in the mill, before being placed in three barrels (one new, another in its second year and the other old). To begin with, little was expected from the wine, but ageing for 18 months has given it a unique brilliance, as well as a completely distinctive freshness and fragrance. It was bottled and aged for a year and a half in the bottle before being launched on the market. This wine, like Solstício 2009, is always better the day after opening the bottle.

This very ancient vine, totally untrained, lost in the heart of the Douro region, is a gift from our forefathers. South facing, in the Cima Corgo area and planted more than 130 years ago, this is one of the oldest Douro vines that we know. The wine was bottled early to maintain its freshness, minerality, youthfulness and aromatic purity, and it is expected to age very  well in the bottle.\nBesides being a matchless wine, each bottle is unique, since the label was individually designed by the artist João Noutel. A particularity of the magnum and double magnum bottles is that they bear the signatures of everybody working for Niepoort.

Consequently, vines were on average two weeks behind their normal growth cycle in previous years. On the other hand, very low temperatures were recorded in the winter, resulting in consistent and balanced growth. The ripening period was cooler than normal, leading to a good balance between sugar and acidity, an essential factor for a fresh and balanced palate. The grapes were all harvested on 11 September.\nFermentation was in stainless steel tanks, with 25% of stems. The period of contact between solids and liquids lasted 5 weeks in a delicate process with very light maceration and limited extraction. \nTurris aged for 15 months in two 1000-litre barrels with more than 60 years old and which were carefully brought from the Mosel region in Germany. The wine was bottled without fining or filtering.","tastingNotes":"The intense youthful colour, slightly open, leads us to a deep, markedly mineral and crystalline aroma. It is impressive in its purity and finesse, with fresh, red fruit and a spring-like floral note. In the mouth it is fresh, silky but with great tension.

Eduard Karel Jacob van der Niepoort died early and it was his son, Eduard Marius van der Niepoort, Dirk’s grandfather, who gave purpose to the demijohns by bottling the best wines of the 1931 harvest, thus creating the type “Garrafeira Niepoort”. Since the distant year of 1931 to this day the maturation in the demijohns, sealed with a cork, has been closely watched, it is almost a “sacred” ritual for both the Niepoort and the Nogueira families. Garrafeira is not just a wine; it means by itself quality far above the traditional canons. On the taste reveals a great mixture of sensations, aromas and flavours with a perfect balance between youth and experience, between the novelty of the fruit and the “good old age” that only long years of ageing can achieve.","image":"/file_7367c5ee-0d4b-4763-9a98-160af8ce9376.png","techSheets":[{"title":"1977","vinification":"With the exception of a brief period in July, the summer of 1977 was very mild. In June, blooming was marked by some blossom drop (which led to a poor cluster formation). In late August, the vines showed signs of slow development. However, in early September, heat returned and with it a rapid ripening of the grapes. Like in almost all classical years, it rained slightly before the harvest, thus allowing the vines to recover the water levels and to complete a more perfect maturation process. The harvest began near the end of September.\nThe entire vinification was made in traditional granite lagares, with 100% stems. During fermentation, the musts showed very dark colours with hues of purple and an excellent balance and acidity. The wine then spent five years in casks in the cellars of Vila Nova de Gaia, and in 1982 it was bottled in demijohns, where it remained for 28 years, under close watch, in search of the perfect occasion for decantation into bottles. This occurred in 2007 and since then the wine has rested quietly in the Niepoort cellars in Vila Nova de Gaia until September 2011, when it was considered perfect for tasting!","tastingNotes":"Still young in the colour, it is brownish red in the centre and more orange towards the board.

Long finish and a very pleasant taste.","producer":"Niepoort (Vinhos) S.A.","region":"Douro","soilType":"Schist","vines":"Old Vines of the subregion Cima Corgo","averageVineAge":"80 years and over 100 years","castVarieties":"Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz, Tinto Cão, Tinta Francisca, Touriga Nacional,Tinta Amarela, Sousão and others","vinesHA":"4000-6000","harvestPeriod":"September/October","wayOfHarvest":"Hand picked","fermentation":"Lagares (wine press tanks)/Foot treadind","ageing":"Casks (3 to 6 years) and demijohns (about 20 years)","foodSuggestions":"Garrafeira is a fine and elegant Port and is best appreciated on its own and in good  company.\n","alcohol":20.5,"totalAcidity":3.96,"residualSugar":109.7,"baume":3.9,"totalSO2":32,"image":"/file_e4a16c15-b56a-4672-9d0c-0355cc6d3c98.jpg","description":"The second generation of the Niepoort family, in the late 19th century, had the fortunate idea of buying from a german glass factory in Oldenburg about 4000 demijohns of dark-green glass with varying capacities from 8 to 11 litres. Eduard Karel Jacob van der Niepoort died early and it was his son, Eduard Marius van der Niepoort, Dirk’s grandfather, who gave purpose to the demijohns by bottling the best wines of the 1931 harvest, thus creating the type “Garrafeira Niepoort”. Since the distant year of 1931 to this day the maturation in the demijohns, sealed with a cork, has been closely watched, it is almost a “sacred” ritual for both the Niepoort and the Nogueira families. The introduction of the Garrafeira 1977 in the market was preceded by in-depth analyses, extensive tastings (very interesting, by the way), so that we could be sure of making the right choice and that, at that moment, we stand before a near-perfect wine! In fact, the Garrafeira is not just a wine; it means by itself quality far above the traditional canons. The tasting offers an unique experience, indeed one that only those who taste and feel can explain. A great mixture of sensations, aromas and flavours with a perfect balance between youth and experience, between the novelty of the fruit and the “good old age” that only long years of ageing can achieve."}],"region":"Douro"},{"title":"VV","description":"Congratulations to Niepoort on its 170th anniversary!\nTo celebrate this occasion, we decided to bottle 999 bottles of the \"new\" old VV, in which we tried to combine the concentration and richness of the original VV with the refinement and purity that increasingly characterises Niepoort wines.

Limpid, crystalline, with a clearly marked tear. An explosion of great intensity and concentration on the nose. Silky and enveloping, it transmits, successively, aromas of dried fruit, raisins, honey, fireplace smoke, cigar leaf and coffee. On the mouth, the wine envelops the whole palate with rich, delicious flavours, combined with a vibrant acidity, resulting in an intense wine with an appreciable freshness. The finish is long, very long and pleasant.\nThere are no perfect wines? There shouldn't be! Because it's always possible to do better...
